# General

## Battle.net Cache

The game needs all of the original map data in order to play back a replay.
For ladder replays, the Windows and Mac client will automatically download any missing dependencies if they are missing.
The Linux build however runs in an offline mode, so these dependencies need to be provided manually.

A prepopulated cache is provided for all of the replay packs.
To install the data, copy the "Battle.net" folder into the root directory of the data package.

The same issue occurs for if you want to play on these ladder maps.
For simplicity, the loose .SC2Map files are provided which have no dependencies on the Battle.net cache.
